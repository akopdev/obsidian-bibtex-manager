# Obsidian BibTeX Manager

![Create New Note in Obsidian BibteX Manager](docs/screenshots/cover.png)

Obsidian plug-in that simplifies the process of managing academic references by enabling the creation of literature notes from a BibTeX entry, 
displaying formatted reference lists, and generating citations instantly. 

This plug-in operates seamlessly on both desktop and mobile platforms, and does not require external dependencies.

## Motivation

For each reference in Obsidian I create a dedicated literature note that contains meta information about the source of citation. BibTeX is a common way to store references in academic writing,
that is why I decided to create a plug-in that would allow me to easily create literature notes just by copy and pasting the entry and save time on manual data entry. 

The plug-in also supports automatic formatting of reference lists within the note, while keeping the original BibTeX entry unmodified. I use this feature to keep source BibTeX file unmodified, 
while having a nicely formatted reference list in the note. 

Unlike other plug-ins, I support mobile platform as a "first-class citizen", meaning there are no dependencies on external services or desktop-only features.

You can use BibTeX entries from Zotero, Mendeley, or any other popular reference managers, as well as use rely on custom BibTeX implementation.

## Features

- Generate literature notes from BibTeX entries using customizable templates. This feature allows for the quick and easy organization of academic references.
